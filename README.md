# Game-of-Life
3d Conway's Game of Life

Made in Unity at the request of a friend in a few weeks. You can change the rules for each number of neighbors in the top right by left, middle, or right clicking. Has an edit mode, to create the initial state you like, which works like Minecraft, and also has a way to save and load previous initial states. You can then switch to sim mode, which can run automatically at a set speed or step by step.
